I'm happy to answer questions and look into bugs on a best-effort basis. This means that I sometimes respond quickly but sometimes take a few weeks when I'm busy.

There is a strict rule to open one issue per individual question. You might have multiple questions about the Dreamer agent or its implementation in this repository. In this case, open multiple issues for them. This lets others easily find existing questions and lets me keep an overview.
